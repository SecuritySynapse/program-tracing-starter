# Program Tracing

## Add Your Name Here

## Re-type the sentence "I adhered to the Allegheny College Honor Code while completing this project."

TODO: You must retype the sentence here in order to digitally sign your pledge.

**IMPORTANT:** If you do not type the required sentence then the course
instructor will not know that you adhered to the Allegheny College Honor Code
while completing the project.

## Program Selection

TODO: Please provide a list of the **names** and **GitHub repositories** for the
five projects that you used as subjects to conduct your program tracing
experiment. Importantly, please note that these subjects need to be executed
either through your interactive use of the program (i.e., through its web
interface, command-line interface, or text-based interface) or through its test
suite. You cannot use projects that you created for a class at Allegheny College;
you must use real-world projects created by external software developers.

### Take Home Points

TODO: Provide a two to three sentence statement about the key takeaways from
conducting this experiment. Please note that the course instructor will display
some student takeaways on the course web site and use them to facilitate
follow-on discussions during the class and laboratory sessions.
